This is a study project, an *introduction* to the *Unity Engine* in the *3D* perspective. The game is a simple *FPS*, that has some very simple concepts. The player must:

- Get an order of items to proceed
- Shoot hostile turrets
- Avoid mines and a hostile plane
- Escape the island

The project includes implementations of several things. The most important:

- Terrain

- Simple AI State Machine
- Particle Effects

Final Notes
---
Feel free to study and create projects based on this repository, but always add the appropriate credits. All assets I used were free on the Asset Store and weren't used commercialy. Believe me, if I could, I would rewrite it from scratch, but it works as it is so it does its job.
